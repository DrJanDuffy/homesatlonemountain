Buying a home in Lone Mountain requires strategy and local knowledge. Here are my top tips for 2026 buyers.

## 1. Get Pre-Approved First

Before you start touring homes, get pre-approved for a mortgage. In Lone Mountain's competitive market, sellers prefer buyers who are ready to move quickly.

## 2. Know the Neighborhood

Lone Mountain has distinct micro-neighborhoods, each with its own character:
- **North Lone Mountain**: Newer construction, larger lots
- **Central Lone Mountain**: Established homes, mature landscaping
- **South Lone Mountain**: Closer to Summerlin amenities

## 3. Understand the Market

Current Lone Mountain market conditions:
- Median price: $550,000
- Average days on market: 35
- Typical price range: $400,000 - $2,000,000

## 4. Consider Future Value
